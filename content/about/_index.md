I live in Amsterdam with my girlfriend Katie.

I've been doing Android since 2014. In 2018 I started at Backbase, and since
then I've gotten really into learning the ins and outs of API/library
maintenance.

I have a few open source libraries on [GitHub](https://github.com/drewhamilton).
I've contributed to a few commits to more prominent open source libraries, and I
hope to contribute many more.

Sometimes I update my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qK8DZWJZCEGdq_cHe7KWVzp6fbJlhVrOipapGdUtAr4/edit?usp=sharing).
